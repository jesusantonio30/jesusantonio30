Hey there! I'm Jesus Morales! 🚀
I'm a Full Stack Developer who's absolutely passionate about building amazing apps with code! At 23 years old, I'm always excited to dive into new technologies and challenge myself to learn and grow. 💻✨

When I'm not coding, you’ll probably find me reading my favorite manga, One Piece (yes, it's my all-time favorite anime/manga 🏴‍☠️), exploring new tech trends, or traveling the world with my beautiful girlfriend!

I’m all about pushing the boundaries and having fun with what I create. Let’s connect, collaborate, and make something incredible together! 🔥
